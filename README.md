This project is the **tensorflow implementation** for paper "SGCN:Sparse Graph Convolution Network for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction" in CVPR 2021, and we also use a new dataset [MOT-15](https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT15/) to test it.

[Here](https://github.com/shuaishiliu/SGCN) is the original pytorch code. We rewrite the original author's code by tensorflow.

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01528.pdf)

## Running

Keep this file structure and run the file "Main_SGCN_MOT15.ipynb" directly by [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

"metrics.py" implements loss functions.

"model.py" implements network model.

"utils.py" processes dataset.

"Visualization.ipynb"  shows the visualization of the trojectory.

"dataset/data" file includes MOT-15 datasetï¼Œwhich has been processed.

"dataset/ETH" file includes eth dataset.

"dataset/hotel" file includes hotel dataset.

## Result

**Warning**: due to the different DL frame, tensorflow version is not exactly the same with pytorch version. Like the way to intial convolution layer kernel.

### ADE & FDE
|   Metric\Dataset   | ETH  | HOTEL | MOT-15 |
|  ----  | ----  |
| ADE  | 0.83 |0.49 |0.14|
| FDE  | 1.56 | 0.78 | 0.25|

### Visulization

Green line is the target trojectory and the red line is the prediction trojectory. The result where the two trajectories seem to overlap is good.
